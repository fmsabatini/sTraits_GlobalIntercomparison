**Timestamp:** `r date()`  
**Drafted:** Francesco Maria Sabatini  
**Revised:**  
**Version:** 2.1  
**Changes of version 2.0:** CWM calculated both for the whole vegetation plot, and for each growth form separately (=layer). For those plots for which we have no EUNIS classification, I added a classification of forest plots into broad forest types based on the leaf phenology and leaf type of tree species received from Jens Kattge (TRY5_GrowthForm_LeafType_Phenology_2022_09_19.xlsx).  
**Changes of version 2.1:** Script rerun on sPlotOpen v1.2  


This notebook calculates CWMs for plots in sPlotOpen, separately for vegetation layers, as required by Benjamin Dechant. It also includes a classification of forest plots into broad forest types, i.e.,:  

- ENF:  evergreen needleleaf forest  
- DNF: deciduous needleleaf forest  
- EBF:  evergreen broadleaf forest  
- DBF: deciduous broadleaf forest  
- MF:  mixed forest (i.e. the rest)  

Each plot is assigned to the main vegetation type based on the dominant growth form. For the dominant growth form the cumulative relative cover is also given, so that different thresholds can be used for filtering 'pure' vegetation types against mixed vegetation types.

Legend of key column names:  
- gf_coverage: cumulative (plot level) relative cover of species having growth form information  
- Layer: vegetation layer (all, trees, shrubs, herbs)  
- Layer_cover: cumulative relative cover in vegetation layer  
- vegtype: vegetation type of plot. Only plots with more than 70% of relative cover with growth form information are classified.   Forest: the cumulative relative cover of tree species is > 10%; Shrubland: the cumulative relative cover of tree species <10% and the cumulative relative cover of shrubs >10%.  
- LT: Leaf Type (B=Broadleaf, N=Needleleaf, LL=Leafless)  
- LP: Leaf Phenology (E=Evergreen, D=Deciduous)  
- TraitCoverage_cover: The cumulative relative cover of all those species having both growth form and trait information in a plot.  
- Species_richness: Number of species occurring in each layer of each plot, notwithstanding the availability of trait or growth form information  
- TraitCoverage_pa: Proportion of Species_richness in a plot for which both growth form and trait information is available.
